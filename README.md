**Client in FX Market** is a cut-down version of a project in my former workplace that was not released due to operations shut-down. The prompt of the study was to create a better understanding of the new client, and also investigate where else we can further support their business. 

**Subject**: Client operates in the Foreign Exchange market and offers a bespoke travel card, that trades in low rates against the high-street banks.
